# HeartDiseasePredictor_v1.0
This project analyzes heart disease risk using the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. We preprocess data, apply a Binary Logistic Regression Model, and evaluate performance using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The ROC Curve helps assess the modelâ€™s classification capability.
